# Neural-Networks-Challenge

In this challenge I've done the following:
To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, I will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. I will do the following:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.
