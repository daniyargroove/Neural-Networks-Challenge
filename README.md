# Neural-Networks-Challenge

In this challenge I've done the following:
To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants would be successful, I created a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. I have done the following:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.

## Technologies

This project leverages JupyterLab in association with Anaconda distribution and the Conda package manager. The following packages are also used:

pandas - Data analysis toolkit for Python.

sklearn - Predictive data analysis.

tensorflow.keras.models - Open source machine learning platform.

keras - Deep learning API running on top TensorFlow.
